        <p>
            In contrast to LWC, property binding is unidirectional. Properties can pass information down, but 
            not up. To pass information up, you use events. For instance, lightning-input passes information
            up in the payload of the change event it fires. Note one more difference here: as in Visualforce rendering 
            happens server-side, a server trip is needed to update the property. In LWC, rendering happens client-side.
