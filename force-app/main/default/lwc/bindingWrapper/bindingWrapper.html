            In contrast to LWC, property binding is unidirectional. Properties can be used to pass information down, but 
            not up. To pass information up, use events. For instance, lightning-input passes information
            up using the payload of the change event it fires. Another important difference is that Visualforce is rendered on the server side.
            This means that a server roundtrip is required to update the property whereas, in LWC, rendering happens on the client-side.
